# ChatGPT Tampermonkey Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Tampermonkey scripts designed to enhance your ChatGPT experience. These scripts automate tasks such as optimizing prompts, exporting conversations, and more. As the repository grows, each script will be listed below for easy reference.

## Available Scripts

### 1. **Prompt Optimizer**
- **Description**: Automates the process of optimizing raw prompts by sending them to a dedicated ChatGPT session for optimization, waiting for the response, and then asking the optimized prompt in the initial session.

### 2. **Conversation Exporter**
- **Description**: Captures and exports the HTML-rendered ChatGPT answers into a downloadable file.

(Additional scripts will be listed here as the repository expands.)
