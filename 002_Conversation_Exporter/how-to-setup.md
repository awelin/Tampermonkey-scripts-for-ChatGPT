## Conversation Exporter

### üîç Introduction

The **Conversation Exporter** is a Tampermonkey userscript that allows you to **instantly download the entire ChatGPT conversation** as a beautifully formatted `.html` file ‚Äî preserving all AI-rendered content and styles. It‚Äôs especially useful for researchers, students, and writers who want to archive AI responses for offline access or later review.

### ‚ú® Features

* **One-key export**: Press `Ctrl + M` to export the entire visible conversation.
* **Preserves formatting**: Includes headers, paragraphs, code blocks, and syntax highlighting.
* **Offline ready**: The exported HTML file is self-contained and viewable without an internet connection.
* **Auto-titled**: The file will use a timestamp as its filename, e.g., `chatgpt-convo-2025-05-05-20-13.html`.
